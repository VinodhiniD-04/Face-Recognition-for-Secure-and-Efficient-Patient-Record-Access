## Overview

Face recognition technology offers a modern solution to enhance hospital security and efficiency in healthcare settings. This project aims to implement a secure face recognition system for quick and accurate access to patient records. By capturing and analyzing unique facial features, healthcare facilities can create a database of patient facial images linked directly to medical records. This enables instant facial scans and record cross-referencing, bolstered by a user-friendly interface for streamlined access by healthcare staff.
